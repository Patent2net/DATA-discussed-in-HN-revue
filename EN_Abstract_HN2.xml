<snippet>after spectacular end of classical genial einstein-bohr physics (pct/ib00/00843, exemplary search: "pct gazette" april 2001), this development of new physics (combined pctifr0211308; /2583; 12709) crushes definitively ridiculous construction of humanity impass for centuries (including essential of consecutive modern physics), making feasibility of fantastical applications too evident: apriori agreement about synchronism of distanced observers, ridiculous trick of schrödinger equation, quantum spin of separated particles, special "law" of symmetry violation, famous quarks are examples of impass falseness. oppositely, developing network of new physics is perfect. nature of electric and gravitational fields is definitively confirmed with conducting electronic and muonic neutrinos (nu) and antineutrino (anti-nu) with frequent periodic "trains" of particle transformations. contrary to 2nd thermodynamic law, all radiation does not leave universe, because of complete reflections from borders, behind which there is no nu and anti-nu. at periodic universe contractions, this concentrated radiation makes explosions (big bangs). "gravitation lenses" are due to elevated nu and anti-nu concentrations near colossal masses. galaxies with disks (and spirals) are created by luminous exploded matter, seized by black holes. overlight speeds of (charged) cosmic "rays" guarantee almost complete passage through sun and moon, without interaction with electro-magnetic fields of matter. radioactivity is due to cause of knocking by such "rays" (protectable, changeable). big bang condition imitations permit to create titanic stable temperatures. increase of forces and speeds of directing electric and magnetic fileds in accelerators (with help of nu and anti-nu beams, also developed) produces particles with colossal overlight speeds. such superaccelerators produce radiation shorter than gamma, that could produce very frequent electric current, that could produce directly electromagnetic waves (direct visible light too). destruction (in any depth!) of targets can be done with special combination of such beams. correct falseness proofs of michelson and of short pulses application in time-resolved spectroscopy.

<snippet>a safe and quick gas operated syringe that pierces the skull and brain of a fish includes a hollow syringe in which a high pressured gas can be dispatched. the present invention places the end stop of the syringe perpendicular on to the skin or scales of the fish in which the brain is located. the needle is retained inside the syringe via a spring and piston until the high pressure valve actuator induced gas forces the needle out of the syringe and into the brain of the fish. a high pressure gas is expelled out of the end and sides of the needle causing complete brain destruction and immediate death to the fish. a sealed gas cartridge is attached to an actuator which instantly presents pressured gas into the syringe cylinder which plunges the piston with attached needle to the end stop of the syringe . the needle protrudes past the end stop of the syringe of which touches the fish head over top of the cranial area and penetrates the fish brain. the needle is the means in which high pressure gas is introduced to the brain matter of the fish.the syringe uses a trigger exhaust valve to rapidly deploy high pressure gas to cylinder, piston, and through the needle into the fish brain and simultaneously expels the high pressure gas from the syringe into the brain causing a quick and painless destruction of the fish brain. once the trigger is released the gas expelled through the needle and syringe cylinder no longer has pressure to compress the return spring and the needle returns into the syringe to the rest stop for safety and is ready for the next deployment.the high pressure cylinder can be easily installed or removed and can be utilized for several cycles with the use of the quick valve assembly. the present invention once placed on the brain area of the fish with the end stop will quickly and instantly upon activation of the device kill the fish. a piston shall be thick enough on the side walls in order to maintain the straight and true travel of the needle out of the cylinder and equally true into the fish. a piston shall have a cavity open from the top surface of the piston to the bottom surface of the piston allowing high pressure gas to flow through the attached hollow needle. a piston with a centred hollow needle on the down stroke side is similar in diameter to the interior diameter of the syringe and maintains a seal allowing for a build up of pressure against the piston causing an unrestricted sliding motion inside the syringe cylinder. a high pressure cylinder is attached to a quick flow valve via an air tight seat and is attached to the syringe via an air tight seat. all discharge from the actuator enters the syringe cylinder and push's the piston to the end stop of the syringe cylinder. the outer surface of the syringe end stop is pressed against the fish cranial area allowing the positioning of needle attached to the piston to penetrate the brain of the fish and expel its pressured gas upon activation. a needle that is long enough to penetrate the brain of the fish will expel the remaining high pressure gas from the downward side of the high pressure valve and out of several side ports in the needle to destroy the brain immediately. a spring on the down stroke side of the piston will compress upon the activation of the high pressure valve from high pressure pushing on the up side of the piston. once the piston is fully traveled down to the end stop of the syringe the release of pressure through the needle will allow the piston to return travel via the compressed spring until the spring ceases to be compressed and the piston positions itself at the rest stop. fish have been killed in various ways over the years: (i) once a fish is caught for keeps, it is left out of the water to suffocate to death. (ii) once a fish is caught for keeps , it has its gills sliced separating oxygen and blood supply suffocating the fish to death. (iii) once a fish is caught for keeps, it has its head cut from the top down causing spinal cord separation from the brain and resulting in death to the fish. (iv) once the fish is caught for keeps, it has its skull crushed by a club or other blunt object causing death to the fish. (v) once the fish is caught for keeps, it has a steel cylindrical object forced into and penetrating the brain, ultimately killing the fish. meat. the present invention allows for less time worrying about killing the fish and more time enjoying the art of fishing. ultimately the present invention is the least offensive way to kill a fish on a humanitarian perspective. the forgoing object and summary provides only a brief introduction to the present invention. to fully appreciate these and other objects of the present invention as well as the invention itself, all of which will become apparent to those skilled in the art, the following detailed description of the invention and the claims should be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. throughout the specification and drawings identical reference numerals refer to identical or similar parts. many other advantages and features of the present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying sheets of drawings in which a preferred structural embodiment incorporating the principles of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example . for the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiment illustrated in the drawings. specific language will be used to describe same. it will be understood that no limitation of the scope the invention is thereby intended, alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device and further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein being contemplated as would normally occur to skilled in the art to which the invention relates.

<snippet>the destruction of the rainforests in the last decades has become the biggest crime against humanity and against nature and against other entire species of animals, and also the biggest irreversible folly of the late 20th century and beginning of the 21st. various statistics show that at the current rate of destruction, unless drastic changes are made right now, by the year 2020 or even considerably earlier, 90-100% of all the rainforests will be irrevocably destroyed, causing damages that will take millions of years to repair, if at all. more plant and animal species will go through extinction within our generation than have been lost through natural causes over the past two hundred million years. this massive deforestation and extinction, which is continuing to increase at an accelerated rate, brings with it many ugly consequences, including but not limited to: air and water pollution, soil erosion, malaria epidemics, the release of more co2 into the atmosphere, decrease of oxygen for us to breathe, more increase in the global warming, and of course the irrevocable loss of huge biodiversity and with them for example the loss of many potentially highly important plants and medicines. the present invention tries to solve this horrible situation by creating an organization and method for motivating as many people as possible to take immediate action -- by creating a strong financial incentive that makes helping preserve the rain forests much more profitable than destroying them. preferably the idea of sustainable harvesting is combined with the idea of selling real acres to people, so that instead of buying something only on paper, preferably an organization or multiple organizations are created, which make sure that the acres that were bought for example from the governments of the relevant countries, are indeed under supervision and protection and that preferably as many of them as possible are preferably also used for sustainable harvesting. the acres themselves can be for example actual specific acres as defined for example by exact coordinates on a map, or for example virtual or "floating" acres, that are not bound to a single location but are more like shares in the organization that sells and takes care of these acres. this is preferably combined with a recursive multi-level marketing plan with various sophisticated improvements over the prior art. in addition, this is preferably combined with carbon-rights trading, which makes the model even more sustainable financially and/or similar trading of other rainforest values or rights, and also shown is an improved model of carbon-rights trading and/or of trading of other rainforests values or rights, so that it ensures also a total- sum of co2 production which is lower than what would have been without the carbon-- rights trading, and/or so that preferably the model works with a formula that requires saving additional rainforests land from the trading revenue in order to avoid keeping the total amount of destruction the same, however such tradings of values are preferably based on general commitment of countries to pay for the services provided by the existence of the rainforests and/or for avoiding the deleterious effects that would happen if they were continued to be destroyed, and not in exchange for being allowed to cause similar or other damages.

but none of such lifetime have been wisely spent because all conquerors and/or winners have died, much as all ordinary people and losers do. therefore, all their cunning, brutal, and hell-for-leather rampages, campaigns, maneuvers, intrigues, duplicities, chicaneries, deceptions, etc eventually have been but foolish dissipations of lifespan in vain in pursuit of any thing but that which can last. and furthermore, billions of innocent people have already been defrauded, deceived, brainwashed, victimized, and/or inflicted in respect to the authentic and genuine truth and true reality of universe containing life, mind, and other existences. even as recent as december 2012, delusional faiths in the country of india of multiple faiths had driven many indian men into gang-raping and murdering their fellow country woman in a most uncivilized manner. all people's all uncivilized conducts and inner sufferings can only ultimately root in delusional faiths because only their deceptive faiths, beliefs, and hence mindsets drive them into their behaviors and then ways of life. the most significant invention is the one that significantly extends human lifespan. although throughout the human history there have been countless failed attempts and tricks to protract inevitable deaths, none of these tricks has successfully extended anyone's lifespan for even few decades. had these inventions not come to fruition, and so long as the human race can still endure the living conditions on this planet, people will continue enduring short lifespan and diseases, and countless faith predators will continue defrauding, brainwashing, victimizing billions of faith victims, as since the emergence of humankind on this planet they have always battened on their faith victims throughout the world and even have sexually exploited/molested the innocent children of their faith victims in none other than the places of worship. the places of worship are also sometimes used as their bases for other crime: as, some faith predators have actually been charged for selling child pornography, etc in none other than the places of worship. therefore, these inventions are of unprecedented and historic significance, practicality, and value since they qualify to extend lifespan, and to prevent future billions of innocent human beings from continuously being defrauded, brainwashed, victimize, and/or harmed by faith predators with their delusional faiths, and they revolutionize and upgrade the vision, sphere, and capability of the humanity. my qualification cannot manifest it clearer to me that the effective ways and strategies to prevent or reduce the sufferings of innocent lives from continuing being misled, brainwashed, victimized, and/or harmed are to create revolutionary devices to extend lifespan, and design the ultimate telescope outclassing all others so as to achieve resolution and power billions of times higher than any existing telescopes and so on. as a member of true integrity and righteousness of the human species and we are stumbling across one another on the universal yet against-our-will-journey of aging towards inevitable death instincts, i am behooved and honor-bound to provide the humankind with these inventions to upgrade human lifespan and to dispel the worldwide spiritual plague and precipices of delusional faiths, misled beliefs, misled perceptions, misled preconceptions, misled information, misled knowledge, misled science, etc that have been deluding, victimizing, and/or afflicting the humanity since its emergency tens of thousands of years ago. only in so doing, said deceits, frauds, whoppers, delusions, etc against humankind can be so lifted and dispelled that mankind will no longer suffer in ignorance, delusion, deceit, pseudo-science, etc. only the correct knowledge, insight, and faith about mind, life, and universe can be qualified, on all terms for anyone, to harness and/or manifest ̈to the ultimate maxima ̈the human potential of the mind and/or the body; otherwise, all talents, knowledge, knowing, faculties, etc are perpetually limited and confined within the spheres of apparent reality without ever becoming qualified to be expanded into, upgraded into, or evolved into true reality transcending beyond apparent reality. only by living true reality guided by the ultimate faith (the truly correct and hence functioning faith/belief system) anyone can become qualified for life to enjoy mind freedom -including emotional freedom, etc ̈and omniscience in the sphere of true reality beyond apparent reality, resulting in becoming qualified to harness to the maxima of his or her human potential both of the body and mind to live true reality is selfsame as to live genuine "virtual paradise/heaven" without the requirement of deaths that must be required for all people plagued by conventional and mainstream delusional religion/belief/faith systems to fantasizing their delusional paradise, heaven, resurrection, reincarnation, etc. perpetually motivated and controlled by their lifelong laziness, ignorance, and inability in making any honest living; and hence by their lifetime subsequent compulsion and greed to batten on, take advantage of, and victimize their fellow inscient human beings, faith predators plaguing humankind have always been defrauding, victimizing, and brainwashing countless faith victims and even their innocent in-between children with diehard delusional belief systems into believing that the universe and its existences have been created by a big bang singularity, god, or other supreme beings; into believing killing many tigers, sharks, bears, etc only to eat their penises, fins, pawls, etc to hallucinate attaining virility, longevity, etc; and into insist claiming that they have been abducted by aliens or witnessed aliens; into lying that they have experienced deaths only to have returned from their near death experiences; into believing that the earth is hollow with aliens living inside; into believing that the world would end on a definite date though i know that it is impossible to accurately predict future events with certainty from the perspective of the totality of the universe, into believing that lives have been integrated with and associated with recyclable souls, afterlife, reincarnation, hell, heaven, ghost, self, and innumerable other delusional beliefs; into even committing mass suicides as the 39 brainwashed faith victims of the heaven's gate religion in california of the usa had done; into becoming suicide murders as the 19 brainwashed hijackers' delusional faith had engineered 9/11 event, etc; into lying and canonizing someone's coincidental events as interceding miracles, etc; and ̈above all ̈into forever mistaking apparent reality for true reality, and hence acting upon living, suffering, and wasting their entire lives for such a state of mistaking apparent reality for true reality and some years ago at a 1996 press conference nasa had even deceived and defrauded our human species' for enthusiasm and government founding by having fraudulently claimed that on earth a piece of rock, containing evidence of life, arrived from mars had been found, but in fact it can never ever be probable for any life to ever exist or have ever existed anywhere else throughout the entire universe. and it can never ever be probable for anyone to find any evidence of life on mars or anywhere else except earth. the law of randomness established by me states that ultimately on the one hand anything must encompass an element of randomness; on the other hand, only randomness can cause anything or state to achieve the culmination of that thing, much as only hand-polished lens can attain the ultimate precision of their size. and then the law of uniqueness likewise established by me states that, at the level tending to either infinite large or small and no matter how adamantly a person desire otherwise, everything throughout the universe must be and can only be unique; therefore, there cannot be another planet or any other heavenly body like the earth which sustains life. therefore, there has never been, and never is, and will never be any life anywhere throughout the entire universe. for example, albeit popes have always done their best to conceal their secrets from their donors for decades, the above two laws had recently dictated a unique butler of one of the popes to have just divulged some of the vatican secrets against all their ardent wills to hide them. of course, all these faith predators plaguing their victims can for life box themselves in delusional faiths and blind themselves from true reality, but by so doing they can never ever become qualified to tap into their human potential to the maxima. and one of the most practical potentials is to enjoy lifelong true happiness, peace, etc. it is because faith predators and their victims have lied so much with their ingrained delusional faiths that their deceptive mindset gradually strikes root in their entire being so much so that they can only redeem and salvage themselves with exceptional resolutions and efforts to seek the truly correct belief system ̈the ultimate faith. ultimately, it is because it is impossible for any delusional faiths to function in extricating, delivering, or redeeming anyone from sufferings (such as stress, anxieties, depression, ptsd, mind vexation, insomnia, obesity, addiction, vainness, emptiness of aim, anger, figment, etc) that certainly the faith predators plaguing their victims and even their innocent in-between children can choose to become diehard delusional-faith followers till the end of life by enduring them, living them, and boxing themselves up with them ̈as billions of their ancestors had already suffered an

<snippet>ever since the inception of internet, hackers from different countries have been successfully defeating many governments and more than 70 corporations around the world in cyber warfare: as, the usa, canada, taiwan, south korea, japan, and many others according to the news broadcasted by cnn, cbc, etc. all their helpless and unstoppable defeats only root in their lack of one of my inventions titled: ultimate cyber security switch. only this invention is qualified to defeat all individual and government-sponsored hackers by preventing and stopping them from hacking into any cyberspace that is protected by this invention. therefore, this invention can save all these losing countries billions if not trillions of us dollars each and every year of losses from intellectual properties, military intelligence, economic intelligence, financial information, etc. and since many ages ago, people have been mining gold with wash plant, panning, etc hoping and fantasizing becoming rich. but existing sluice and riffle systems are simply too inefficient with a lot of gold loss through the sluice and riffle systems. hence, i have invented a series of revolutionary gold mining equipments and processes to expedite gold production yet minimize loss. moreover, the law of no largest, or smallest, or any other absolute limit established by me states that throughout the universe nothing can be the smallest or the largest. there is never either upper or lower physical limit to anything throughout the universe. there is perpetually something smaller than the smallest particle that can ever be found; there likewise is perpetual something larger than the largest expanse that can ever be found. therefore, higgs boson (or god particle) sought in the hadron collider in switzerland, or any other so-called particle can never ever be the smallest particle because there perpetually is something even smaller than the smallest particle that can ever be found according to this law. the law of time delusion established by me states that in fact time is but a delusion because there is no reality in any time. it is only because time is but a delusion that other animals live in perpetual non relativity with no concept or sense of time. and it is also only because time is but a delusion that the selfsame number of hours or any other periods of time to the selfsame person are felt and perceived completely different whenever and if he or she falls asleep and whenever and if he or she fells anxious. and it is also only because time is but a delusion different people can agree on an arbitrarily set or assigned time. albert einstein and a plethora of other scientists are absolutely wrong about the nature of time. because time is but a delusion, any attempt to seek any form of time travel is foolishness, failure, and waste of life in the making. time travel, such as einstein's rosen bridge, wormhole, higgs singlet, time travel portal, or any other form of time manipulation is absolutely impossible though people can always so fantasize, just as a lot of people would always waste lives fantasizing immortality though it is impossible. it is likely foolish for anyone to believe that nazi bell could somehow manipulate time by spinning red mercury, etc because time is but a delusion. the law of inevitable randomness establish by me states that only by involving randomness in one way or another rather than regulated or calibrated actions and/or processes any ultimate state can be attained. for example, in order to polish any mirror to its ultimate resolution possible, random polishing process must be implemented. to expand this law to other area, according this law albert einstein's spooking communication theory is also a fraud because it is but random coincidence by which two distant objects sometimes exhibit entanglements, same behaviors, etc, not any dictating law or regularity. but einstein had mistaken the random coincidence between two distance objects for the act of law or regularity. furthermore, ultimately on the one hand anything must encompass an element of randomness; on the other hand, only randomness can cause anything or state to achieve the culmination of that thing, much as only hand-polished or random-action-polished lens can attain the ultimate precision of their size. and then the law of uniqueness likewise established by me states that, at the level tending to either infinite large or small and no matter how adamantly a person desires otherwise, everything throughout the universe must be and can only be unique; therefore, there cannot be another planet or any other heavenly body like the earth which sustains life. therefore, there has never been, and never is, and will never be any life anywhere throughout the entire universe. the law of uncertainty also established by me states that there perpetually exists an element of uncertainty in all human affairs (especially whenever and if great interest becomes at stake), any phenomenon, and any existence. for example, albeit popes have always done their best to conceal their secrets from their donors for decades, these laws had recently dictated a unique butler of one of the popes to have just divulged only few unimportant vatican secrets against all their ardent desires to hide the truth from the donors, supporters, and followers. ever since the split second on such a birthday when the human species had emerged onto earth, people have killed and harmed one another to establish empires, wealth, power, predominance, social strata, fame, successes, etc for selfish aggrandizement; but none of such lifetime have been wisely spent because all conquerors and/or winners have died, much as all ordinary people and losers do. therefore, all their cunning, brutal, and hell-for-leather rampages, campaigns, maneuvers, intrigues, duplicities, chicaneries, deceptions, etc eventually have been but foolish dissipations of lifespan in vain at the pursuing for any thing but that which can last. and furthermore, billions of innocent people have already been defrauded, deceived, brainwashed, victimized, and/or inflicted in respect to the authentic and genuine truth and true reality of universe containing life, mind, and other existences. even as recent as december 2012, delusional faiths in the country of india of multiple dysfunctional faiths had driven many indian men into gang-raping and/or murdering women in their country in the most uncivilized manner. all people's all uncivilized conducts and inner sufferings can only ultimately root in delusional faiths because only their deceptive faiths, beliefs, and hence mindsets drive them into their behaviors and then foolish ways of life. their faiths are delusional and hence they are dysfunctional because the ultimate faith always functions. all conventional faiths/belief systems have always been predicated on the diffusions of lies, frauds, deceits, misinformation, deceptions, and brainwashing that are devised to batten on, defraud, and abuse their parishioners, other followers, and their innocent children. had these inventions not come to fruition, and so long as the human race can still endure the living conditions on this planet, people will continue enduring countless faith predators that will continue defrauding, brainwashing, victimizing billions of faith victims, as since the emergence of humankind on this planet they have always battened on their faith victims throughout the world and even have sexually exploited/molested the innocent children of their faith victims in none other than the places of worship. the places of worship are also sometimes used as their bases for other crime: as, some faith predators have actually been charged for selling child pornography, etc in none other than the places of worship. therefore, these inventions are of unprecedented and historic significance, practicality, and value since they qualify to prevent future billions of innocent human beings from continuously being defrauded, brainwashed, victimized, and/or harmed by faith predators with their delusional faiths, and they revolutionize and upgrade the vision, sphere, and capability of the humanity. my qualification cannot manifest it clearer to me that the effective ways and strategies to prevent or reduce the sufferings of innocent lives from continuing being misled, brainwashed, victimized, and/or harmed are to live the correct faith ̈the correct belief system. as a member of true integrity and righteousness of the human species and we are stumbling across one another on the universal yet against-our-will-journey of aging towards inevitable death instincts, i am behooved and honor-bound to provide the humankind with these inventions to upgrade human knowledge so as to dispel the worldwide spiritual plague and precipices of delusional faiths, misled beliefs, misled perceptions, misled preconceptions, misled information, misled knowledge, misled science, etc that have been deluding, victimizing, and/or afflicting the humanity since its emergency tens of thousands of years ago. only in so doing, said deceits, frauds, whoppers, delusions, etc against humankind can be so lifted and dispelled that mankind will no longer suffer in ignorance, delusion, deceit, pseudo-science, etc. only the correct knowledge, insight, and faith about mind, life, and universe can be qualified, on all terms for anyone, to harness and/or manifest ̈to the ultimate maxima ̈the human potential of the mind and/or the body; otherwise, all talents, knowledge, knowing, faculties, etc are perpetually limited and confined within the spheres of apparent reality without ever becoming qualified to be expanded to, upgraded into, or evolved into true reality transcending apparent reality. only by living true reality guided by the ultimate faith (the truly correct and hence functioning faith/belief system) anyone can become qualified for life to enjoy mind freedom ̈including emotional freedom, etc ̈and omniscience in the spher
